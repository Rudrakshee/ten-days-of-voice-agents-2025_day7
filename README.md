# 🎙️ Murf AI Voice Agent – Day 7  
**Food & Grocery Ordering Voice Agent**

This repository contains my submission for **Day 7** of the Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge.  
For this task, I built a voice-based **Food & Grocery Ordering Agent** that can:

- Load a food & grocery catalog from a JSON file  
- Understand item requests, quantities, and “ingredients for X”  
- Manage a full cart (add, update, remove, list items)  
- Auto-add bundled recipe ingredients  
- Place the final order and save it to an order JSON file  
- (Optional) Track order status and access order history  

## 📌 Current Status  
At the moment, **only the demo video has been uploaded** to this repository.

## 🔧 Coming Soon  
The following will be uploaded shortly:

- Frontend implementation  
- Backend logic  
- Full project structure and documentation  

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
